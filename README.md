# image_manipulator
 codecademy ap csa java project: 
 
 leverages BufferedImage and ImageIO classes for image conversion between image and 2D arrays holding pixel data
 
 traverses pixel data arrays and manipulates orientation through index reversal / changes colors through RGBA getter methods and rgba array manipulation
 
 generates random images/rectangles by passing in 2D image arrays, color integers, etc as arguments to methods and utilizing row-major traversal and conditional statements to create image outputs through traditional file IO
